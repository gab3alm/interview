Desktop Version of Interview Project

##Instructions
I still need to create the production config file, so no fancy production build for right now.
If you want to continue development, just copy the repo into your local machine.
Make sure to have node js and npm installed in your computer.

Using a terminal:
go into the folder of the project and type
npm install

This will install all the project dependencies.
after that finishes, just type
npm run dev

Once that thingy finishes, you should have a webpack dev server up and running
just go into your browser and type 
localhost:8080
